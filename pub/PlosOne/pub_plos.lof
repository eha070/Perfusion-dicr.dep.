The two curves have an almost perfect overlap. Note that the numbers used for the perfusion is unrealisticely high since normalization is performed with respect to the volume of only one voxel. Right: Red curve shows the computed impulse response functions (IR) at location [1,20] using the global arterial input function. Blue curve shows the analytic impulse response function given by a convolution over all upstream flow. The two curves have an almost perfect overlap. These numerical experiments support that the computed impulse response function by traditional methods is not the directly feeding impulse response function, but rather a recursive impulse response function depending on all upstream voxels.\relax }}{16}{figure.caption.3}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces {\bf Perfusion as a discretization dependent measure.} Perfusion within a small volume. Left: A compartment with volume $2V$ is exposed to a flow $F_0$ [$\si {\milli \meter \cubed \per \second }$] of fluid. By definition, the perfusion within this compartment becomes $P_{1} = F_0/(2V)$. Middle: The same volume is divided into two compartments (e.g. voxels), and the perfusion for each of the compartments becomes $P_{2} = F_0/V = 2P_{1}$. Discrepancy between the two discretizations occurs because the flow is counted twice as it is fed from one voxel to the other. Right: As a solution to the described problem we rather pick out a true distribution volume $\Delta V$ (area in this 2D sketch), which is a small area around a given streamline along the centre line of the grey area. This is the true distribution volume (area in this 2D sketch) which is fed with arterial blood from the incoming fractional flow $\Delta F_0$. The correct perfusion within $\Delta V$ is therefore $\Delta F_0/\Delta V$. The entire compartment can further be divided into similar infinitesimal distribution volumes, thus providing locally correct perfusion estimates.\relax }}{17}{figure.caption.4}
